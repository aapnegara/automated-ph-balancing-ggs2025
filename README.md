# automated-ph-balancing-ggs2025

the project was made for compete in Bali International Science Fair 2025 where we (i mean, my student) won gold medal and 2025 International Science Project Competition where we won Silver medal, the instrument then refired by another group of student for competing in 2025 PIKIR Scientific Paper Competition where we ended up as a top 10 finalist.

If you get to this repository from the qr code that I tempel in the instrument, welcome. First thing you need to do is to pasang the sensor ph since the current instument have no sensor (aku meminjamnya dari orang lain), just follow the structural design that I upload in this repo.


many thanks to my student who participate in this project

# automated-ph-balancing-ggs2025

The project was originally built to compete in the Bali International Science Fair 2025 (Gold Medal) and the International Science Project Competition 2025 (Silver Medal). Later, the instrument was reused and refined by another group of students for the 2025 PIKIR Scientific Paper Competition, where we reached the Top 10 Finalists.

If you found this repository through the QR code attached to the instrument — welcome!
The first thing you’ll need to do is install the pH sensor, since the current instrument does not include one (I borrowed it from someone else). Just follow the structural design files uploaded here in this repository.

Many thanks to the students who participated in this project:

BISF + ISPC Team: Kayla, Michelle, Adlyna, Cheryl, Victoria, and Kiyoko (joined only for ISPC)

PIKIR Team: Alya, Clarissa, Lydia, and Jason
